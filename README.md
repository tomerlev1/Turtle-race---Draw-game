# Turtle-race---Draw-game
Here in those files i've used python's turtle module. 
It helped me build my own "turtle race" game and "etch-a-sketch" game.
I'd wrote a clean and readable code in order to show my coding skills 🥂

** The turtle module is build in and you don't need to install it specifically.
